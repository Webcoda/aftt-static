                                                <p>Kim fell in love with the medium of film at the ripe old age of five when she first saw the movie <em>Jaws</em>. That initial moment of inspiration provoked her to dedicate her life to filmmaking. She began her film career as a continuity woman working on independent feature films such as <em>Bitter &amp; Twisted, Gabriel, Left Ear</em> and over 40 short films.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Going on to pursue a path as a storyteller, she has written and directed seven short films, which have collectively screened at over 60 festivals internationally and received 22 awards. Her work has screened on The Comedy Channel, Foxtel and SBS.</p>

<p>In 2012, she directed <em>IFSS Uncut</em>, a four-part TV series for Foxtel about the craft of short filmmaking, which screened primetime on Sunday nights.</p>

<p>In the past few years she has worked extensively in the field of documentary creating powerful stories for non-profits and charities such as CanTeen, CerebralPalsy Alliance and The Cancer Council, as well as directing TVCs and branded content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She is currently in post-production on a feature documentary about the empowerment of women in Nepal which will premiere mid 2016.&nbsp;</p>

In 2009, Biederman took his innovative staging of Schnitzler&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>La Ronde</em>&nbsp;to the New York International Fringe Festival where, in addition to critical acclaim, both actors received Best Actor awards for the festival. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Biederman spent seven seasons with San Francisco&rsquo;s American&nbsp;Conservatory Theater, directing and serving in many senior&nbsp;capacities&nbsp;on the A.C.T. artistic staff, and as Associate Director of their M.F.A.&nbsp;program. Bay Area productions include Peter Barnes&rsquo;&nbsp;<em>Red&nbsp;Noses</em>, a&nbsp;Critic&rsquo;s Choice named one of the year&#39;s 10 best productions.</p>

                                                <p>Paul has been under the spell of cinema since he accidentally saw &lsquo;Taxi Driver&rsquo; at the age of 8. That same year, his parents took he and his siblings to war-torn Beirut to see their ancestral homeland before it completely imploded. They also went to Disneyland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The absurdity of these vastly different experiences profoundly influenced Paul&rsquo;s work and life. He has been an ardent student and practitioner of many facets of the screen craft, beginning his career in his late teens as a freelance camera operator and editor.</p>

<p>As a filmmaker, he has written, produced and directed numerous award-winning short films, including &rsquo;Squalor&rsquo;, &lsquo;Pavel&rsquo; and &lsquo;Fragments&rsquo;, which took him to New York in 2005.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Paul is also a former graduate of IFSS. He returned to the school to teach screenwriting and within two years, he was promoted to the Head of Teaching, overseeing the development of the school curriculum and managing the faculty and students.</p>

<p>In 2014, Paul decided to pursue a screenwriting opportunity in Los Angeles after his pitch for an original TV series, &lsquo;Zealot&rsquo;, garnered strong interest from multiple production companies. He was mentored by leading industry consultant and former TV exec, Jen Grisanti, who championed the project. During his time in LA, Paul also had a chance meeting with a well-known U.S. director, who gave him an opportunity to write a feature screenplay. The film is currently in financing stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2015, he was commissioned to create the multi-platform sci-fi project &lsquo;Gish&rsquo;, through which he developed his first comic book with artist&nbsp;<br />
Marcelo Baez. After securing finance for his low-budget feature film, Paul is set to direct the production at the end of 2016.</p>

<p>He is also a professionally trained actor, having appeared in local and international productions, including &lsquo; East West 101&rsquo;, &lsquo; Love My Way&rsquo; and &lsquo;Farscape&rsquo;, as well as numerous TVC&#39;s and stage productions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides sharing his passion and knowledge of the craft as a tutor, Paul also works as a script consultant for multiple screenwriters and directors across the globe.</p>

                                                <p>For almost two decades Woody&rsquo;s acting roles in film, theatre and television have not only nurtured his dramatic instinct, they&rsquo;ve allowed him to explore the dramatic arts extensively. He&rsquo;s worked on productions in Australia, Tahiti, Japan, UK and America before a five-year stint in which he called Hollywood home. Here his acting branched into teaching and &nbsp;film production.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a trainer, Woody desires to encourage others to understand their empathetic self by attaining the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Woody aims to inspirer his students to evolve their artist voice, their creativity and to develop a strong point of view through teaching them a true understanding of themselves and how they relate to their craft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having written, produced and directed fashion videos, art films, short films, behind the scenes, and commercials, Woody has become an experienced camera operator, editor and colorist. Woody has a keen eye for capturing moments and conveying visually appealing and interesting stories. His work both in front of and behind the camera gives him a great sensibility and understanding of film production.&nbsp;</p>
